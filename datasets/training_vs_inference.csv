year,training_pct,inference_pct,source_note
2018,90,10,"Estimated; inference minimal as few production AI deployments existed"
2019,85,15,"Estimated; early GPT-2/BERT deployments beginning; training dominated"
2020,80,20,"Estimated; GPT-3 era; training compute growing fast; inference starting to scale"
2021,75,25,"Estimated; broader AI deployment in search/recommendations; still training-heavy"
2022,67,33,"Deloitte/industry estimates; ChatGPT launch late 2022 drove inference demand spike"
2023,67,33,"Deloitte; inference ~1/3 of all compute; training still majority of resources"
2024,55,45,"Industry estimates; AI 2027/SemiAnalysis data; leading AI company training ~40% of internal compute"
2025,50,50,"Deloitte; inference reaches parity with training; AI cloud inference spending $9.2B"
2026,33,67,"Deloitte projected; inference dominates; AI cloud inference spending $20.6B (55% of $37.5B)"
2027,30,70,"Projected; AI 2027 forecast shows leading company training drops to 20% of internal compute"
2028,28,72,"Projected; continued shift as deployed AI agents/applications scale"
2029,25,75,"Projected extrapolation; reasoning/agent workloads drive inference"
2030,30,70,"Various projections (McKinsey/MarketsandMarkets); ~70% of DC demand from inferencing; training still grows in absolute terms"
