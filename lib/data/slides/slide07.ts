      title: "THESIS A - MACRO CONSTRAINT",
      tone: "primary",
      body: "The post-1950s monetary and political order is entering a regime of tightening constraint. Public debt is high, interest burdens are rising, geopolitics are fragmenting, and institutional credibility is weakening. Policy flexibility narrows: sustaining restrictive real financial conditions becomes progressively more costly. The adjustment path is a structural repricing toward assets with direct claims on real resources and productive capacity, and away from purely nominal financial claims."
    },
    {
      title: "THESIS B - AI INFRASTRUCTURE",
      tone: "secondary",
      body: "Frontier AI is shifting from incremental software gains to a general-purpose production technology that substitutes for economically productive cognitive labor. Productivity gains can be real while the buildout becomes capital- and energy-intensive, constrained by physical bottlenecks: power, chips, cooling, grid capacity, minerals, and land. The result is a mixed macro impulse: deflationary in cognition, inflationary in the physical layer that enables it."

  intersectionTitle: "THE INTERSECTION",
  intersectionBody:
    "These forces are not offsetting - they compound. AI raises potential output, but it also increases capital intensity and strains scarce inputs (power, grid hardware, chips, and minerals) inside a macro regime with less policy room to absorb shocks. As AI displaces labor, the political response skews toward redistribution and industrial policy - further widening structural deficits and reinforcing the drift toward real-asset repricing.",
  intersectionConclusion:
    'Net: deflationary in cognition, inflationary in resources - creating convexity in hard assets and physical bottlenecks, while compressing returns in undifferentiated information and "model-only" layers.',
