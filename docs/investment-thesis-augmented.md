# Stack Intelligence — Investment Thesis

## What This Document Is

A self-contained explanation of the Stack Intelligence investment thesis with all supporting data embedded. A reader — human or AI — can understand the full strategy, verify every claim against the underlying evidence, and evaluate the fund mechanics without needing the presentation deck or any other source materials.

---

## 1. What Stack Intelligence Is

Stack Intelligence is a liquid global macro fund. The strategy is quant and value-oriented, trading across equities, commodities, FX, bonds, crypto, and derivatives. Everything is fully liquid under normal market conditions.

The fund is built around a single conviction: two structural forces — fiscal dominance driving real-asset repricing, and AI infrastructure buildout consuming scarce physical resources — are compounding simultaneously, and the physical layer where they intersect offers durable, asymmetric returns.

This is not a technology bet. It is a physical infrastructure and macro regime bet. Every GPU cluster needs power, copper, and concrete. Every fiscal deficit erodes the purchasing power of nominal claims. The fund positions at the intersection.

## 2. The Macro Regime

### 2.1 Federal Debt Is Structural, Not Cyclical

U.S. federal debt-to-GDP has risen relentlessly over more than a century, with step-ups after every major fiscal event and no sustained reversals. The trajectory is now politically locked in.

**Key data points from the CBO/GAO series (1900-2053):**

| Year | Debt/GDP | Context |
|------|----------|---------|
| 1900 | 10% | Baseline |
| 1916 | 4% | All-time trough |
| 1919 | 30% | Post-WWI peak |
| 1929 | 15% | Pre-Depression |
| 1945 | 104% | WWII peak |
| 1946 | 106% | Post-war peak |
| 1974 | 24% | Post-war trough |
| 1993 | 49% | Reagan-era buildup |
| 2000 | 35% | Pre-dot-com |
| 2007 | 35% | Pre-GFC |
| 2009 | 55% | Post-GFC |
| 2019 | 79% | Pre-COVID |
| 2020 | 100% | COVID step-up |
| 2024 | 99% | Current |
| 2026 | 102% | Projection begins |
| 2035 | 120% | Mid-range projection |
| 2045 | 147% | |
| 2053 | 166% | Terminal projection |

### 2.2 Interest Expense Is Crowding Out Fiscal Flexibility

Debt service is now a major budget item and growing faster than revenue. Three series tell this story:

**Net interest, program spending, and revenue as % of GDP (2000-2053):**

| Year | Revenue % GDP | Program Spending % GDP | Net Interest % GDP |
|------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 2000 | 20.0% | 15.9% | 2.3% |
| 2007 | 18.0% | 17.6% | 1.7% |
| 2009 | 14.6% | 22.7% | 1.3% |
| 2019 | 16.3% | 19.0% | 2.0% |
| 2020 | 16.3% | 29.4% | 1.8% |
| 2024 | 17.1% | 20.3% | 3.1% |
| 2026 | 18.0% | 19.8% | 3.2% |
| 2030 | 18.0% | 20.0% | 3.6% |
| 2035 | 18.6% | 20.7% | 4.1% |
| 2040 | 18.7% | 21.2% | 4.6% |
| 2045 | 18.8% | 21.7% | 5.1% |
| 2050 | 18.9% | 22.1% | 5.6% |
| 2053 | 19.0% | 22.4% | 5.9% |

**Interest as % of federal revenue (1965-2035):**

For every $5 the government collects, $1 now goes to interest. This ratio has moved from ~7.3% (mid-1960s) to ~18.1% (2024), with projections reaching ~22% by 2035. The long-run low was ~7.0% in the mid-1960s. Projection begins in 2026.

Key waypoints: 7.3% (1965), 17.5% (1985), 11.5% (2000), 7.2% (2015), 18.1% (2024), 22% (2035 projected).

### 2.3 The Term Premium Is Back

After a decade in negative territory, the 10-year term premium has returned to positive levels. Investors are again demanding compensation for holding long-duration government debt.

**ACM term premium series highlights:**
- Peak: ~1.73% (2002)
- Trough: ~-0.61% (2020)
- Latest: ~0.60% (January 2026)

Recession periods shaded: 2001 (Mar-Nov), 2007-2009 (Dec-Jun), 2020 (Feb-Apr).

### 2.4 This Is Global, Not Just American

Japan and the UK are repricing long-run fiscal and monetary constraints simultaneously:

**Japan:**
- 10-year yield: moved from negative (~-0.28% in 2019) to ~2.21% (2026)
- USD/JPY: rose from ~77 to ~157, a major yen repricing
- YCC adjustment: December 2022

**United Kingdom:**
- 10-year gilt yield: from ~0.21% (post-pandemic trough) to ~4.48%
- GBP/USD: fell from ~1.55 to ~1.35, with a trough near 1.13
- Key events: Brexit (June 2016), Truss mini-budget (September 2022)

Source: FRED, Bank of Japan, Bank of England.

### 2.5 Core Inflation Has Settled Above Target Everywhere

Inflation has not returned to pre-COVID levels across any major developed economy. Every country in this sample sits above the 2% central-bank target:

| Economy | Pre-COVID (approx) | Peak | Latest (approx) |
|---------|-------------------|------|-----------------|
| U.S. | ~2.0% | — | ~2.8% |
| Euro Area | ~1.1% | ~5.7% (2023) | ~2.5% |
| UK | ~1.8% | ~7.1% (2023) | ~2.6% |
| Canada | ~1.9% | ~5.5% (2022) | ~2.5% |
| Australia | ~1.7% | ~6.8% (late 2022) | ~2.7% |

Projection horizon begins: October 2025.

Source: Goldman Sachs.

### 2.6 Inflation Concentrates Where Supply Cannot Scale

Cumulative price changes by category (2000-2025) show massive dispersion. The things the economy physically needs are the things getting most expensive:

| Category | Cumulative Change |
|----------|------------------|
| Hospital Services | +281.4% |
| College Tuition | ~+180% |
| College Textbooks | ~+160% |
| Childcare | ~+140% |
| Medical Care | ~+120% |
| Avg Hourly Wages | ~+100% |
| Housing | ~+90% |
| Food & Beverages | ~+80% |
| Overall CPI | ~+75% |
| New Cars | ~+40% |
| Home Furnishings | ~-10% |
| Clothing | ~-10% |
| Cell Phone Services | ~-50% |
| Computer Software | ~-70% |
| Toys | ~-75% |
| TVs | -98.1% |

Dispersion between highest and lowest: 379.5 percentage points. Items where supply scales digitally (TVs, software, phones) have deflated. Items where supply is physically constrained (hospitals, housing, energy) have compounded upward.

### 2.7 Policy Uncertainty Is Structural, Not Episodic

Four independent uncertainty indicators all remain well above their long-run baselines:

| Indicator | January 2026 Value | Baseline | Multiple of Baseline |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|---------------------|
| Trade Policy Uncertainty | 2,205 | 100 | 22.1x |
| Fiscal Policy Uncertainty | 438 | 100 | 4.4x |
| Geopolitical Risk Index | 164 | 100 | 1.6x |
| CBOE VIX | 22 | 20 | 1.1x |

### 2.8 The U.S. Still Grows — But Growth Alone Doesn't Solve the Problem

**Growth leadership:**
- 2026 GDP: U.S. 2.4% vs Eurozone 1.3%, Japan 0.7%, UK 1.3%
- Labor productivity: +4.9% annualized in Q3 2025
- S&P 500 net margin: 13.2% in Q4 2025, fifth straight quarter of double-digit earnings growth
- New business applications: 5.48M in 2023, 48% above pre-pandemic
- VC deployed: $215B in 2024 (+29% YoY)
- Household net worth: $173T, debt service at 11.3% of disposable income
- R&D: $892B in 2022 (est. $940B in 2023), 3.43% of GDP

**Energy and AI capital dominance:**
- LNG exports: 111 MMT in 2025, first above 100 MMT globally
- Crude: 13.5M bbl/d, net energy export at record 7.8 quads
- Private AI investment: $109B (2024) vs China's $9.3B
- Notable AI models: U.S. produced 40 vs China's 15
- CHIPS Act: $380B+ in private semiconductor commitments; TSMC Arizona 4nm in high-volume output
- U.S. equities: 50.2% of global market cap; 63 of world's 100 largest public companies

**But the vulnerabilities are deep:**
- 46 nonfuel minerals above 50% import reliance, 15 at 100%. China controls ~90% of rare-earth refining.
- Taiwan holds ~92% of sub-10nm chip capacity. U.S. reshoring scales mostly in 2027-2031.
- Only 16% of pharmaceutical API facilities are domestic (down from 28% in 2019).
- Agriculture in persistent deficit (-$32B FY2024).
- Infrastructure scored C overall in 2025; half of categories in D range with a $3.7T investment gap.

**Fiscal math is unforgiving:**
- USD reserve share: declined to 58% from a 72% peak in 2001
- All three agencies downgraded U.S. sovereign credit (S&P 2011, Fitch 2023, Moody's 2025) — no AAA remains
- U.S. 1-year CDS reached ~52 bps in May 2025, briefly pricing near BBB+-style sovereign risk
- Social Security and Medicare trust-fund depletion timelines both moved to 2033
- BRICS: 11 members and 10 partners, 44% global GDP PPP
- Inequality: Gini ~0.48, top 1% holding 30.5% of wealth vs 2.5% for bottom 50%

**The tension:** The U.S. can still grow, but the growth path leans on fiscal expansion, AI-driven labor disruption, and commodity-intensive reindustrialization. That can raise GDP while also increasing deficits, inflation sensitivity, and policy-volatility beta. Growth alone is not a fiscal exit.

## 3. The Case for Real Assets

### 3.1 Gold Has Overtaken Treasuries in Central Bank Reserves

Sovereign reserve managers are actively diversifying away from dollar-denominated debt. The crossover happened in the 2020-2025 window:

- Central-bank gold holdings: ~$1.8T (2020) → ~$5.1T (late 2025)
- Treasury holdings: ~$4.05T (2020) → ~$3.6T (late 2025)

Source: IMF, Department of Treasury.

### 3.2 Central Bank Gold Buying Is Structural

Annual net purchases exceeded 1,000 tonnes in three consecutive years (2022, 2023, 2024) and remained elevated at ~863 tonnes in 2025. Years 2022-2024 are the highlighted period. Net purchases include both reported and estimated unreported activity.

Source: World Gold Council, Gold Demand Trends FY2025.

### 3.3 The Gold-Rate Relationship Broke in 2022

Gold traditionally moved inversely with real yields. That relationship broke after January 2022. Gold reached new highs in the sample even as real 10-year yields repriced sharply higher from their 2021 lows. Gold is now priced as a hedge against institutional and sovereign risk, not against rate levels.

Source: Federal Reserve, Bloomberg.

### 3.4 Priced in Gold, U.S. Equities Have Made No Progress Since the GFC

The S&P 500-to-gold ratio fell from ~100 to ~67 on the index basis (Q1 2006 = 100). Equities have kept pace with money supply growth but not with real store-of-value assets.

Source: S&P Global, LBMA, IndexMundi.

### 3.5 New Supply Cannot Respond for Decades

Mine development timelines have tripled in three decades. Even if demand signals are clear today, new supply is physically constrained:

| Period | Years to Production | Category |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| 1990s | ~6 years | Operating |
| 2000s | ~10 years | Operating |
| 2010s | ~15 years | Operating |
| Recent operating | ~18 years | Operating |
| Non-operating (projected) | ~28 years | Projected |

### 3.6 China Refines 19 of 20 Strategic Minerals

China's refining share across IEA-tracked strategic minerals sits in the 75-100% band. Average market share: ~70%. Gallium: 98.7%. Magnesium: 95%. Rare earths: ~90%. Supply concentration is broad, not isolated to niche inputs.

Source: IEA Critical Minerals report.

### 3.7 Critical Mineral Demand Is Accelerating

Under the IEA's Stated Policies (STEPS) scenario, every tracked mineral faces a supply gap:

**Demand index (2024 = 100):**

| Mineral | 2024 | 2030 | 2035 | 2040 |
|---------|------|------|------|------|
| Lithium | 100 | ~222 | ~340 | ~453 |
| Cobalt | 100 | ~155 | ~210 | ~270 |
| Nickel | 100 | ~145 | ~195 | ~250 |
| Copper | 100 | ~117 | ~122 | ~128 |

Copper is the largest tonnage bottleneck at ~26.7 Mt of 2024 demand. Lithium starts from a smaller base (~0.205 Mt) but grows fastest. Both growth rate and absolute scale matter for underwriting supply gaps.

**Copper supply-demand gap:** Demand rises from ~27 Mt (2024) to ~34.1 Mt (2040) while modeled supply declines toward ~22 Mt. By 2035, the implied deficit is ~27% — even if every announced project proceeds.

### 3.8 Silver, Copper, and Uranium Are Repricing on Structural Demand

Since the 2022 trough, copper has rebounded to ~144 on the index basis while silver has risen toward ~299. The repricing is driven by converging demand from electrification, AI infrastructure, and reshoring:

- **Copper:** EVs, solar buildout, and AI data centers all push demand higher. Supply remains slow because major new mines take nearly two decades.
- **Silver:** Industrial demand exceeds mine supply for the fourth consecutive year. Solar consumes ~20% of annual production while monetary demand rises.
- **Uranium:** Nuclear capacity expansion and hyperscaler interest in baseload power increase long-cycle fuel demand after a decade of underinvestment.

U.S. industrial policy compounds pressure: $280B (CHIPS), $370B (IRA), and $1.2T (IIJA) in capex-heavy buildout. Trade policy and export controls amplify pressure on already tight commodity chains.

## 4. The AI Infrastructure Buildout

### 4.1 Why AI Matters for This Portfolio

AI is a demand driver for the same scarce physical resources the macro regime is already repricing:

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Power demand | 120 GW | Projected U.S. data center load by 2029 (from 4.3 GW in 2023) |
| Copper intensity | 5-10x | More copper per MW in data centers than traditional buildings |
| Capex cycle | $600B+ | Big-4 hyperscaler 2026 capex guidance |

**Electricity consumption comparison (China vs U.S.):**
- China: ~1,356 TWh (2000) → ~10,400 TWh (2025) — showing the scale of power demand that accompanies industrial buildout
- U.S.: ~3,802 TWh (2000) → ~4,260 TWh (2025) — comparatively flat, which is why incremental AI load strains a slower-growing base system

### 4.2 The AI Value Chain: 12 Layers, 75+ Nodes

The fund maps the full AI infrastructure stack from raw materials to end-user access. Investment framing: physical bottlenecks first, capability conversion second, recurring monetization last.

| Layer | Name | Nodes | Key Insight |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Raw Materials, Mining & Industrial Inputs | 13 | Hard assets and permitting cadence set the supply ceiling |
| 1 | Semiconductor Equipment & Manufacturing Materials | 9 | Lithography, deposition, and wafer supply |
| 2 | Chip Design & Semiconductor Manufacturing | 8 | TSMC, NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Broadcom |
| 3 | Passive Components, Substrates & Board-Level Supply | 4 | CoWoS, HBM, PCB |
| 4 | Hardware Systems, Storage & Integration | 3 | Server assembly, storage, integration |
| 5 | Datacenter Physical Infrastructure | 14 | Cooling, racks, UPS, fire suppression |

| 10 | AI Software, Applications & Deployment | 4 | Enterprise AI, vertical apps |
| 11 | Distribution, Edge & End-User Access | 2 | Consumer devices, edge compute |

Portfolio capture favors the constrained physical layers (0-6) before downstream software margins normalize.

### 4.3 Capability Is Still Compounding

AI capabilities are not plateauing — they're climbing steeply on harder benchmarks:

- **ECI frontier benchmark score:** 0.124 (June 2023) → 0.722 (December 2025), about 5.8x in 30 months
- **METR task horizon:** AI can now complete tasks that take humans ~6.5 hours (GPT-5.2). The horizon is doubling every 4.3 months. Median solvable task duration rose from ~0.001h to ~3.943h, with peak at ~6.573h.

### 4.4 Adoption Is Unprecedented

**Consumer:**
- ChatGPT weekly active users: ~50M (Mar 2023) → ~900M (Dec 2025)

**Enterprise:**
- OpenAI: 1M+ business customers (from under 1K two years prior)
- Anthropic: 300K+ business customers
- Google Cloud: 65% of customers using AI
- Cloud AI backlog: roughly doubled to ~$240B

### 4.6 Training Compute and Cost Are Scaling Exponentially

**Training compute:** Has grown 5 orders of magnitude since 2017.
- XLNet-era: ~6.19e21 FLOP
- Recent frontier (GPT-4.5, Llama 4): ~1.51e25 FLOP
- Top estimate (Grok 4): ~5.0e26 FLOP

**Training cost (in 2023 USD):**
- Early large models: ~$22K
- Recent frontier: ~$388M
- Peak estimate: ~$507M

Each generation requires substantially more compute — from roughly 10^21 to 5x10^26 FLOP in less than a decade. Frontier training is now megaproject-scale capex.

### 4.10 Inference Is the Growing Share

Inference share of compute spend is rising from ~10% (2018) toward ~70% by 2030, while training falls from ~90% to ~30%. Models get cheaper per token, but usage grows faster. As workloads shift from single queries to autonomous multi-step agents, inference share compounds and keeps physical infrastructure demand structurally high.

Source: SemiAnalysis, company disclosures, Epoch AI.

### 4.11 The Grid Cannot Keep Up

U.S. interconnection queues: ~350 GW (2014) → ~2,300 GW (current), with a recent peak near 2,600 GW (2023). Average queue-to-commercial timelines stretch 5-7 years. The grid cannot accommodate projected demand without large new transmission investment.

Source: Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, PJM, EIA.

### 4.12 GPU Supply Is a Packaging Story

CoWoS advanced packaging and HBM memory are the second chokepoint after leading-edge silicon. Packaging and memory bottlenecks cap delivered compute even when wafer starts expand. HBM capacity per GPU increases with each generation. Capacity pricing power accrues to upstream physical suppliers.

### 4.13 AI Lab Compute Spend Is Doubling Annually

| Company | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 2025E |
|---------|------|------|------|-------|
| OpenAI | $0.4B | — | — | ~$16.0B |
| Anthropic | — | $0.3B | — | ~$6.8B |

These are estimated compute spend (infrastructure/training/inference cost), not revenue run rate. Every dollar flows into chips, power, and cooling — the physical layer.

## 5. Where These Forces Intersect

### 5.1 AI Is Deflationary in Cognition, Inflationary in Everything It Needs

Physical input demand growth from 2024 to 2030:

| Input | Unit | 2024 | 2030 | Growth |
|-------|------|------|------|--------|
| Electricity | TWh | 415 | 945 | +128% |
| Copper | kt | — | — | +76-100% |
| Aluminum | kt | 400 | 1,100 | +175% |
| Rare Earths | kt | — | — | +76% |
| Advanced Packaging | — | — | — | Bottlenecked |
| Specialized Memory (HBM) | — | — | — | Bottlenecked |

Electricity, copper, grid hardware, aluminum, advanced packaging, and specialized memory all face permitting, geopolitical, and supply-chain bottlenecks.

### 5.2 Labor Displacement Widens Deficits

**AI labor exposure (2025):**
- Global jobs exposed: 25% (ILO)
- High-income economies: 34%
- Low-income economies: 11%

**Employer planning signals (2030):**
- 73% plan task automation (WEF)
- 41% expect workforce reductions (WEF)

Source: ILO-NASK Generative AI and Jobs Index (2025); World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report 2025.

### 5.3 There Is No Fiscally Neutral Path Through AI Displacement

- 84% of FY2024 federal receipts ($4.136T of $4.919T) are tied to labor taxes (individual income + social insurance). VAT, AI-rent, and automation-tax proposals remain exploratory.
- Federal workforce programs: ~$20B today. Down from ~$60B inflation-adjusted in 1979 while the labor force grew ~50%.
- SNAP cuts: $187B estimated reduction (2025-2034) after P.L. 119-21 tightened eligibility.
- OECD active labor market policy spending: U.S. at ~0.1% of GDP vs Denmark at ~1.9%.

60% of advanced-economy jobs are exposed to AI. The U.S. relies on labor-heavy taxes and has not enacted a replacement tax base at comparable scale.

### 5.4 Financial Repression Is the Proven Playbook

The historical precedent for sovereign deleveraging through real-rate suppression:

**1946-1980 repression period:**
- Debt-to-GDP fell from 119% to 32% — a drop of 87 percentage points over 35 years
- Real rates held below nominal growth, transferring wealth from nominal claim holders to the sovereign
- No default, no hyperinflation

**Real annualized returns during repression (1946-1980):**

| Asset | Real Return (annualized) |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Equities | ~+6.8% |
| Long-duration Treasuries | ~-2.0% |
| Real assets | Clustered above nominal bonds |

**Today:** U.S. federal debt-to-GDP has surpassed the 1946 wartime peak (123%) for the first time in history. The same real assets that capture value from the AI buildout are the natural hedge against repression.

## 6. Portfolio Construction and Valuation Context

### 6.1 Passive Equity Is No Longer the Core Return Driver

At current starting valuations, historical forward real return base rates for broad equity beta are materially compressed:

**S&P 500 valuation snapshot (February 2026):**

| Metric | Current | Long-Run Mean | Signal |
|--------|---------|---------------|--------|
| Shiller CAPE | 40.38 | 17.33 | 98.8th percentile |
| Trailing P/E | 29.75 | 16.19 | +84% above mean |
| Dividend Yield | 1.13% | 4.22% | -73% below mean |

**Historical next-10Y real returns by starting CAPE:**

| CAPE Bucket | Median Real Return | P25 | P75 | Observations |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|-----|-------------|
| <10 | +11.0% | — | — | — |
| 10-15 | ~+9% | — | — | — |
| 15-20 | ~+7% | — | — | — |
| 20-25 | ~+4% | — | — | — |
| 25-30 | ~+2% | — | — | — |
| 30-35 | ~+0% | — | — | — |
| 35-40 | ~-1% | — | — | — |
| 40+ | -3.45% | -4.41% | -3.03% | 21 |

The current CAPE of 40.38 places us in the 40+ bucket, which historically mapped to deeply negative forward returns. In high-starting-valuation regimes, alpha and manager selection matter more than passive beta.

### 6.2 How the Portfolio Performs Across Macro Regimes

The fund's scenario matrix identifies four convergence paths, all of which favor the portfolio's positioning:

1. **Fiscal dominance:** Capital controls, financial repression. Governments direct credit and restrict cross-border flows. Hard assets become the only credible store of value as nominal instruments are subordinated to sovereign funding needs.
2. **AI infrastructure supercycle:** Hyperscaler capex floods into data centers, grid upgrades, and mineral supply chains. Physical bottlenecks tighten. Hard-asset holders benefit from both rising demand and scarcity premiums.
3. **Trade fragmentation:** Supply chains re-shore and duplicate across blocs, multiplying demand for physical capacity at its most constrained levels.
4. **Yield-curve control:** Rates pinned below inflation, engineering negative real returns for savers. Capital migrates toward gold, energy infrastructure, and real assets.

### 7.3 Gate-Based Underwriting

Every position passes through institutional gates with explicit failure conditions:

1. End-market growth must remain durable through an entire cycle.
2. No plausible forced-seller path under adverse rates, spreads, or volumes.
3. Return profile must clear hurdle rates without multiple-expansion heroics.
4. Scarcity duration must exceed what current valuation already discounts.

## 9. Risk Architecture

**Risk Factors:**
1. Market risk across concentrated long positions
2. Crypto and FX volatility at the position level
3. Liquidity risk in alternative and smaller-cap positions
4. Correlation risk in macro drawdowns across asset classes
5. Regulatory and geopolitical disruption to portfolio themes
6. Key-person risk concentrated in a small team

**Structural Mitigants:**
1. 10% single-position limit enforces diversification
2. No margin and no outright shorts eliminates forced liquidation risk
3. Multi-asset class exposure (equities, commodities, crypto, FX, Treasuries)
4. Conviction positions sized with defined downside tolerance
5. Quarterly NAV reporting with direct LP-to-GP communication

**Stress Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| -50% portfolio drawdown | No margin means no forced liquidation; fund can wait for recovery |
| Correlation spike | Multi-asset diversification limits single-scenario drawdown |
| Liquidity freeze | Long-only structure with no leverage eliminates margin calls |
| Regime reversal | Conviction positions underwritten with 3-5 year thesis horizon |

A long-only, no-leverage structure with position limits creates natural downside protection. The concentrated thesis creates the upside.
