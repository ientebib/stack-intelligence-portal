- Source line: Source: World Gold Council Gold Demand Trends FY2025; hyperscaler earnings/guidance (Q4 2025 to Q2 FY2026); S&P Global Market Intelligence (2024)

### Slide Intent

- Two foundational macro views.

### Extracted Copy Map

- `thesisCards[0].title`: THESIS A - MACRO CONSTRAINT
- `thesisCards[0].tone`: primary
- `thesisCards[0].body`: The post-1950s monetary and political order is entering a regime of tightening constraint. Public debt is high, interest burdens are rising, geopolitics are fragmenting, and institutional credibility is weakening. Policy flexibility narrows: sustaining restrictive real financial conditions becomes progressively more costly. The adjustment path is a structural repricing toward assets with direct claims on real resources and productive capacity, and away from purely nominal financial claims.
- `thesisCards[1].title`: THESIS B - AI INFRASTRUCTURE
- `thesisCards[1].tone`: secondary
- `thesisCards[1].body`: Frontier AI is shifting from incremental software gains to a general-purpose production technology that substitutes for economically productive cognitive labor. Productivity gains can be real while the buildout becomes capital- and energy-intensive, constrained by physical bottlenecks: power, chips, cooling, grid capacity, minerals, and land. The result is a mixed macro impulse: deflationary in cognition, inflationary in the physical layer that enables it.
- `intersectionTitle`: THE INTERSECTION
- `intersectionBody`: These forces are not offsetting - they compound. AI raises potential output, but it also increases capital intensity and strains scarce inputs (power, grid hardware, chips, and minerals) inside a macro regime with less policy room to absorb shocks. As AI displaces labor, the political response skews toward redistribution and industrial policy - further widening structural deficits and reinforcing the drift toward real-asset repricing.
- `intersectionConclusion`: Net: deflationary in cognition, inflationary in resources - creating convexity in hard assets and physical bottlenecks, while compressing returns in undifferentiated information and "model-only" layers.

- `pipelineSteps[4].tone`: secondary
- `conceptCards[0].title`: Scaling laws
- `conceptCards[0].body`: Performance improves predictably with more data, parameters, and compute. This drives recurring model scale-ups.
- `conceptCards[0].tone`: primary
- `conceptCards[1].title`: Training vs. inference
- `conceptCards[1].body`: Training is bursty and episodic. Inference is persistent and growing, making long-horizon infrastructure demand sticky.

- `conceptCards[2].title`: Physical footprint
- `conceptCards[2].body`: Frontier runs and inference fleets require semiconductors, power delivery, and cooling at utility scale.
- `conceptCards[2].tone`: negative
- `takeawayLabel`: For this portfolio
- `takeawayBody`: You do not need to predict which model wins. Every serious model requires the same physical inputs: chips, copper, power, and cooling.
